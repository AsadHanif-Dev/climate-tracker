## 🎯 Usage

### Adding Activities

1. Select a date (defaults to today)
2. Choose an activity type from the dropdown
3. Enter the amount (distance in km, energy in kWh, or number of meals/servings)
4. Click "Add Activity" to log it
5. The CO₂ calculation is displayed instantly

### Viewing Data

- **Today's Total**: Current day's total emissions
- **7-Day Total**: Weekly emissions with daily average
- **30-Day Total**: Monthly emissions
- **Category Breakdown**: Pie chart showing today's emissions by category
- **Daily Trend**: Line chart showing emissions over the last 30 days
- **Activity Log**: Detailed list of all logged activities, grouped by date

### Managing Data

- Click the ❌ icon next to any activity to remove it
- Use the "Clear All" button to delete all activities
- Toggle between light/dark mode using the theme button in the header

## 🔢 CO₂ Emission Factors

The app uses the following hardcoded emission factors:

| Activity | CO₂ per Unit | Unit |
|----------|--------------|------|
| Car | 0.192 kg | km |
| Public Transport | 0.089 kg | km |
| Flight | 0.255 kg | km |
| Electricity | 0.475 kg | kWh |
| Natural Gas | 0.203 kg | kWh |
| Meat Meal | 7.26 kg | meal |
| Dairy Products | 3.2 kg | serving |
| Vegetarian Meal | 1.7 kg | meal |

*Note: These are approximate industry averages and may vary based on location and specific circumstances.*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Data Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Icons**: Emoji + SVG icons

## 📦 Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This creates an optimized production build and starts the server.

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing CO₂ Factors

Edit [src/constants/co2Factors.ts](src/constants/co2Factors.ts) to modify emission factors.

### Adding New Activity Types

1. Add the activity type to the `ActivityType` union in [src/types/index.ts](src/types/index.ts)
2. Add the corresponding factor in [src/constants/co2Factors.ts](src/constants/co2Factors.ts)
3. Update the select options in [src/components/ActivityInput.tsx](src/components/ActivityInput.tsx)

### Styling

All styles use Tailwind CSS. Modify [tailwind.config.ts](tailwind.config.ts) for theme customization.
